## About DuPSUG 18 – 13th of February in Delft

This is an evening edition of our user group, with a special focus on PowerShell Developer technologies, Azure and of course a deep dive into PowerShell. We will start off the event with a quick bite to eat for our attendees and speakers. We have an evening with diverse and advanced topics prepared for you presented by experienced speakers. If you would like to attend please register through Eventbrite to reserve your seat, as we have limited seats available.

The evening will have a variety of PowerShell and Azure based topics. Barbara will talk about deploy a PowerShell Function App to Azure, in ten minutes. While going in depth to the different choices she made for deployment of this application. Mathias will take us in depth, and show us the inner workings of PowerShell runspaces and how they can be used for parallelization and speeding up your PowerShell code. Jaap will give a short overview how PowerShell can be used to solve small problems in an efficient way.
